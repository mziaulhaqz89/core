```

### 2. Solution Structure

This repository manages the **main** solution containing:
- **HousingUnit** (`cicd_housingunit`) - Housing unit management
- **Lease** (`cicd_lease`) - Lease agreements and contracts  
- **Tenant** (`cicd_tenant`) - Tenant information and details

## üìã Available Workflows

### 1. üîÑ Export Main Solution From Dev
**File**: `01-export-main-solution.yml`  
**Purpose**: Export main solution from DEV environment and create PR

**Features**:
- Automated export of main solution (unmanaged)
- Optional managed solution export
- Custom branch naming or auto-generated timestamps
- Automatic PR creation with detailed summary

**Usage**:
1. Actions ‚Üí "Export Main Solution From Dev" ‚Üí Run workflow
2. Choose solution options (managed/unmanaged)
3. Optionally provide custom branch name
4. Creates PR with solution changes

### 2. üö¢ Deploy Main Solution  
**File**: `02-deploy-main-solution.yml`  
**Purpose**: Deploy main solution through all environments

**Triggers**:
- **Push to `main`** when `mainsolution/**` changes (automatic)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Deployment Flow**:
1. **Pack Solution**: Creates managed solution from source
2. **Deploy to TEST**: Automatic deployment to test environment
3. **Deploy to UAT**: Deployment with approval gate
4. **Deploy to PRODUCTION**: Final deployment with approval gate

### 3. üèóÔ∏è Shared Deployment Pipeline
**File**: `shared-deployment-pipeline.yml`  
**Purpose**: Reusable deployment workflow with intelligent import logic

**Features**:
- Smart solution existence checking
- Intelligent import mode selection (update vs upgrade)
- Environment-specific deployment strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üîß PowerShell Export Script

The repository includes `export-solution.ps1` for local development:

```powershell
# Basic usage (patch increment)
pwsh ./export-solution.ps1

# Minor version increment  
pwsh ./export-solution.ps1 -VersionType "minor"

# Major version increment
pwsh ./export-solution.ps1 -VersionType "major"
```

**Script Features**:
- Automatic version checking and incrementing
- Exports both managed and unmanaged solutions  
- Unpacks solutions for source control
- Colored output with progress indicators

## üéõÔ∏è Environment Setup

### GitHub Environments Configuration

1. **TEST Environment**
   - **Variables**: `TEST_ENVIRONMENT_URL`
   - **Protection**: Optional approval gates

2. **UAT Environment**  
   - **Variables**: `UAT_ENVIRONMENT_URL`
   - **Protection**: Approval gates recommended
   
3. **PRODUCTION Environment**
   - **Variables**: `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_URL`
   - **Protection**: Approval gates required

### Service Principal Setup

1. **Azure AD App Registration**: Create app registration for GitHub Actions
2. **Configure Permissions**: Add Dynamics CRM user_impersonation permission  
3. **Create Secret**: Generate client secret and add to GitHub secrets
4. **Power Platform Access**: Add app user to all environments with System Administrator role

## üîç Development Workflow

### Export Process:
1. **Make Changes**: Develop in Power Platform DEV environment
2. **Export**: Run "Export Main Solution From Dev" workflow
3. **Review**: Review PR changes and validate solution components
4. **Merge**: Merge PR to trigger automatic deployment

### Deployment Process:
1. **Automatic Trigger**: Deployment starts when PR is merged to main
2. **Pack Solution**: Creates managed solution package
3. **Deploy to TEST**: Automatic deployment for testing
4. **Deploy to UAT**: Manual approval required
5. **Deploy to PRODUCTION**: Final manual approval required

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### üîê Authentication Failed
- Verify PowerPlatformSPN secret is correct
- Check service principal has access to all environments
- Validate CLIENT_ID and TENANT_ID variables

#### üèóÔ∏è Solution Export Failed  
- Ensure solution "main" exists in DEV environment
- Check solution name spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify no concurrent edits in Power Platform

#### ‚è∏Ô∏è Approval Gate Issues
- Ensure GitHub environments are configured
- Verify required reviewers are assigned
- Check reviewers have repository access

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development:
- Test changes in DEV environment before export
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Review solution components before merging PRs

### Deployment:
- Schedule PRODUCTION deployments during maintenance windows
- Test in UAT before PRODUCTION approval
- Document significant changes in PR descriptions

### Security:
- Regularly rotate service principal secrets
- Use least privilege access principles
- Monitor workflow runs for suspicious activity
